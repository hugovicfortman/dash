TO USE THE LYNC GUY,
At the base of the function , put in the id of the DOM object you want to use as active user monitoring panel like so:
//
//
//	var test = (function(w,d,divID){ ... })(window,document,"id-of-panel-to-use");
//
//
run function test()// <== Rename "test" to something more suitable
